# ðŸ•’ 0:15 â€“ 1:00 | Part 1 â€“ React Fundamentals
## Goal: Build a strong foundation in React before diving into app logic.

## Topics Covered:
What is React and why use it?

Intro to JSX, components, and rendering

Functional components vs class components

Props and useState

Basic event handling (onClick, onChange)

Mini activity: create a counter or greeting component

âœ… Outcome: Students can build interactive UI using basic React building blocks.

# ðŸ•’ 1:00 â€“ 1:45 | Part 2 â€“ Build the Todo App (Frontend Only)
## Goal: Apply React fundamentals to create the structure and features of a Todo app.

### Topics Covered:
File/project structure in Vite/React

TodoForm and TodoList components

Lifting state up to App.jsx

Handling form input and rendering a list

Managing local state (add/delete todos)

âœ… Outcome: Static, working Todo app using only React (no backend yet).

# ðŸ•’ 1:45 â€“ 2:20 | Part 3 â€“ Express Backend + MongoDB
## Goal: Set up an Express API that can talk to MongoDB and serve the React app.

### Topics Covered:
Create basic Express server

Install Mongoose & connect to MongoDB Atlas

Define Todo schema/model

Create basic routes: GET /api/todos, POST /api/todos

Test with Postman or browser

âœ… Outcome: Backend routes successfully interact with the database.

# ðŸ•’ 2:20 â€“ 2:45 | Part 4 â€“ Full-Stack Integration
## Goal: Connect the React frontend to the Express backend.

### Topics Covered:
Axios: fetch data from backend

Handle form submission with POST

Use useEffect to load todos on page load

CORS or Vite proxy setup

âœ… Outcome: Todos added and loaded from the real database!

# ðŸ•’ 2:45 â€“ 3:00 | Wrap-Up & Next Steps
## Demo final app

Optional features (delete todo, mark complete)

Deployment ideas (Render, Netlify, Railway)
