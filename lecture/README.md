# Root - Hello World
- Create a root
- Render some markup to the root
* The HTML sets up the basic skeleton of the page.
* The style.css defines how things should look.
* The index.jsx defines what should appear and how it should behave.

```
<div id="root"></div>
```
This is an empty div that acts as a mounting point for JavaScript frameworks like React. The entire app will be rendered inside this div by JavaScript.

```
<script src="src/index.jsx"></script> 
```
Loads your JavaScript app (most likely a React app) from the file src/index.jsx.
    * index.jsx contains the code that tells React to render components inside #root.



# JSX as syntactic sugar

JavaScript object
``` 
import { createElement } from "react"
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
const reactElement = createElement("h1", null, "Hello from createElement!")

console.log(reactElement)

root.render(
    reactElement
)
```

## Alternative
```
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
const reactElement = <h1>Hello from JSX!</h1>

console.log(reactElement)

root.render(
    reactElement
)
```

# Props

## Passing Props to a Component
React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.


## Familiar props 
Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, className, src, alt, width, and height are some of the props you can pass to an <img>:


# State

Without useState → You're writing on a piece of paper, and no one is watching you.
With useState → You're writing on a live camera feed, and React is watching — as soon as you write something new, it updates the screen automatically.


🪨 Without useState, your app becomes static
If you store your todos in a regular variable like this:
```
const todos = ["Buy milk", "Do laundry"]
```
React will render that list once, when the component loads. But here’s the catch:
🔄 If the user adds a new todo, the screen won’t update. ✏️ Changing todos.push("New item") won’t make React re-render the list. 🧠 Because React doesn’t "know" anything changed.
React doesn’t watch regular variables. It only watches state and props. That’s how it knows when to re-render a component.

✅ With useState, React reacts
```
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([])
```
Now:
* React remembers the value.
* When you call setTodos([...todos, "New item"]), React:
    * Updates the value
    * 🚀 Re-renders the UI
